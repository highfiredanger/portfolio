  <section class="post-content"><p>For the last couple of months I’ve been going to school at a place called Bloc, based out of San Francisco, the birthplace of my boyfriend (so it must be good). I’m learning Full Stack Web Development there, things like HTML/CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, AngularJS, Ruby and more.</p>

<p>There are definite positives–and definite negatives, too. My first day was a nightmare; I was caught off-guard by several blocker bugs in their software that was helping me learn. But as my mentor said, there are always blockers. This is so true, and has been true for me my whole time programming. The point is to get good enough to move past these blockers by either doubling down, or getting help, which is where the mentor often comes in.</p>

<p>My mentor happens to be amazing. Raj is great at explaining complicated concepts several different ways, which I need. I never understand that cruel saying, “If you can’t do, teach”. This makes no sense to me because teachers have to have extra skills, and they must know their subject matter so well that they can explain it to others. He certainly embodies that and I am very grateful for his help.</p>

<p>Also, the whole organization is set up to give students assistance as quickly as possible. Each time I’ve had a problem, there has been a response within an hour and sometimes even a fix that quick. I am very impressed with their team. I can tell that they hustle quite a bit and are dedicated to making Bloc a good experience for students.</p>

<p>They also have two speeds for the curriculum, I am on the more leisurely of both. I take extra time to learn, so I am grateful for this, too. I don’t think I would have thrived at a shorter code camp. This way, I get more time for extra projects and reading, which I really appreciate.</p>

<p>Now, for the negatives. There have been quite a few bugs in the learning software. Thankfully that was mostly in the beginning, using a tool called Workshop. I think the tool has been trashed, so good riddance.</p>

<p>I also think the curriculum sometimes takes very large leaps in the learning. It’s sometimes as though the author doesn’t remember how difficult it was to learn and so don’t notice the large leaps (ok, maybe it wasn’t difficult for them). Anyway, I’m doing my best despite this.</p>

<p>Phew! The negatives are over. That wasn’t too bad. Overall, Bloc has been a good experience and I feel like I am learning. I might be slower than some but I’m getting there and I feel like the knowledge is building into some solid skills.</p>
