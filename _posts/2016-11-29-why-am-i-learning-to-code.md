title: Why Am I Learning to Code? 
---

Before I went to Bloc for school, I was hunting for product jobs. I've had a few different roles in tech companies: QA, Product, and Marketing, with Product Management always being my favorite. Though, I had several interactions that made me think that it was becoming inevitable for a product person to have a technical background. One interview I had focused so completely on a few undeveloped technical skills I had in my LinkedIn profile that I started to feel a shift. Maybe coding was my next step towards professional proficiency? Similarly, my product mentor started to feel like he needed a technical skill set of his own, and began to learn Ruby. 

Further, my own experience had once told me things were missing too. I suspected I had a knowledge gap because common product tasks like looking at estimates with developers sometimes felt hollow, like I didn't have the entirety of the information I needed in order to succeed. Like being colorblind, I suspected I didn't know what I was missing. 

This is where coding comes in.

I feel code is key in moving forward in this industry for me. In a product role, I think that understanding code will give me a greater confidence when talking to the dev side of the business, and a greater knowledge of what's functionally possible when drawing up use cases. My tentative plan though is getting a job as a developer for awhile and keep learning new skills, but hey, wouldn't hurt to look at product positions while I hunt, too. My goal is to work at a place with great culture and a product I can be passionate about. Will I be in product or in development? I can't wait to find out, and I'll have the technical knowledge to succeed either way.
