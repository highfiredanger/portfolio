title: So I'm Learning To Code
---

Wow, what a journey so far. Coding? It's not as easy as it sounds in that ubiquitous promise of learning in just a few short weeks, at least not for me. 

Learning to code has been one of the most difficult scholastic endeavors of my life, but sure enough, I am learning. Each week I get more competent, gaining a sharper ability to write and read code, and understanding what my mentor says better and better. I look back on old code from when I was first starting and wow! How could I not know exactly what that meant like I do now? The learning is happening, even if it's slower than I expected, and even if I don't necessarily feel it on a daily basis.

As I've gotten further along in my studies, I have noticed that my subconscious does a lot of thinking for me. If I have a particularly hard problem, it helps to walk away and give my brain a chance to mull it over. I know I might not be able to do this at a job necessarily, but I hope that I can. Maybe this is how most people work and it's a common practice for those in coding roles.  

Does one need to be naturally good at coding to succeed? I don't know, but I know it hasn't come quickly to me. A friend of mine says that learning to code has a core competency: perseverence. One is basically learning to get through what seem like impossible problems, over and over. I am definitely getting better at technological troubleshooting, at writing and reading code. 

If you're learning how to code and you find it intensely challenging, don't give up. Ask for help when you can get it. Go to school if you don't want to go it alone. Google it, a lot! Or, go to a place like Bloc where you have a one-on-one mentor and ask lots of questions. If you're feeling discouraged, don't worry. You can do it!
